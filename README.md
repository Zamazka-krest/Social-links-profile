Hi there!
This is my third practice lesson in Frontendmentor and I wanna share you about hard moments I have met.

The first problem was vertical centering. 
I'm still don't remember how to do this, so I'm going to copy this code anywhere it needs idk :P
I need more practice in optimization, because I have a lot of extra code and this may cause problems with reading it.

Secondly, errors occurred during font integration. 
I was not able to integrate it. The integration just didn't work.
However, this problem was quickly solved when I changed the format from "ttf" to "truetype" - this was really a revelation for me!

That's all!
You can help me to improve my code with comment in Frontendmentor.
Thanks for reading!
